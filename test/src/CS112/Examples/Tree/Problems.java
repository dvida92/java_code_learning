    //1.Given a tree, find the number of leaves/full nodes without using recursion, instead use a queue

    //2.Given a tree, find the height of the tree (the distance from the root to a leaf with the longest distance(hops)
    //Using recursion

    //3.Check the structure: given two trees, do they have the same structure? Recursively

    //4.Return the sum of the tree recursively.
