//  Note that you can include other class definitions in the same file, as long

//  They will be accessible to any code in the same directory as this file.

//  This simply defines an exception as a class with no information in it; it is just
//  an object with a name, which can be thrown and caught, and a generic message can be printed out.

class TooSmallException extends Exception {}

//  This is a more complicated example of an exception, in which a constructor
//  is used to create an object which stores a message to be printed out using getMessage(),
//  now we can actually print out a message with information from the exact context in which
//  the error occurred.
